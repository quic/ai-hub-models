headline: Upscale images and remove image noise.
domain: Computer Vision
description: Real-ESRGAN is a machine learning model that upscales an image with minimal loss in quality. The implementation is a derivative of the Real-ESRGAN-x4plus architecture, a larger and more powerful version compared to the Real-ESRGAN-general-x4v3 architecture.
