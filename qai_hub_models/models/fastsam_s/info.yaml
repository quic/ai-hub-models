description: The Fast Segment Anything Model (FastSAM) is a novel, real-time CNN-based
  solution for the Segment Anything task. This task is designed to segment any object
  within an image based on various possible user interaction prompts. The model performs
  competitively despite significantly reduced computation, making it a practical choice
  for a variety of vision tasks.
