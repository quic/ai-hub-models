description: UNet is a machine learning model that produces a segmentation mask for
  an image. The most basic use case will label each pixel in the image as being in
  the foreground or the background. More advanced usage will assign a class label
  to each pixel. This version of the model was trained on the data from
  Kaggle's Carvana Image Masking Challenge (see
  https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge) and is used for vehicle
  segmentation.
