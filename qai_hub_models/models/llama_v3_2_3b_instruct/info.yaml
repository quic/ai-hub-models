headline: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language understanding
  and generation tasks.
domain: Generative AI
description: Llama 3 is a family of LLMs. The model is quantized to w4a16 (4-bit weights
  and 16-bit activations) and part of the model is quantized to w8a16 (8-bit weights
  and 16-bit activations) making it suitable for on-device deployment.
use_case: Text Generation

technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: 128
  Maximum context length: 4096
  Precision: w4 + w8 (few layers) with fp16 activations and w4a16 + w8a16 (few layers) are supported
  Supported languages: English.
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token.
    This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt.
    The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of
    the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context
    length (4096 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
