headline: OpusMT Spanish to English neural machine translation model based on MarianMT transformer architecture.
domain: Multimodal
description: OpusMT Spanish to English translation model is a state-of-the-art neural machine translation system designed for translating Spanish text into English. This model is based on the Marian transformer architecture and has been optimized for edge inference by splitting into encoder and decoder components with modified attention mechanisms. It exhibits robust performance for real-world translation tasks, making it highly reliable for practical applications. The model supports input sequences up to 256 tokens and can generate English translations with high accuracy.
