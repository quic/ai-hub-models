technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: '128'
  Context length: '4096'
  Precision: w4a16 + w8a16 (few layers)
  Supported languages: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese.
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (4096 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
