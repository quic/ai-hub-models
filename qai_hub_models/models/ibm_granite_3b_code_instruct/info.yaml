technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: 128
  Context length: 2048
  Number of parameters: 3.48B
  Precision: fp16
  Num of key-value heads: 32
  Information about the model parts: Prompt Processor and Token Generator are split into 4 parts each. Each corresponding Prompt Processor and Token Generator part share weights.
  Prompt processor model size: 7 GB
  Prompt processor input (part1): 128 tokens
  Prompt processor output (part1): Embeddings output
  Prompt processor input (other parts): 128 tokens + KVCache initialized with pad token
  Prompt processor output (other parts): 128 output tokens + KVCache for token generator
  Token generator model size: 7 GB
  Token generator input (part1): 1 token
  Token generator output (part1): Embeddings output
  Token generator input (other parts): 1 input token + past KVCache
  Token generator output (other parts): 1 output token + KVCache for next iteration
  Use: Initiate conversation with prompt-processor and then token generator for subsequent iterations.
  Supported natural languages: English
  Supported programming languages: The Granite code foundation models support 116 programming languages including Python, Javascript, Java, C++, Go, and Rust.
  Minimum QNN SDK version required: 2.27.7
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (2048 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
