headline: State-of-the-art large language model useful on a variety of language
  understanding and generation tasks.
domain: Generative AI
description: The Llama3-TAIDE-LX-8B-Chat-Alpha1 LLM model is based on Meta's released LLaMA3-8b model,
  fine-tuned on Traditional Chinese data, and enhanced for office tasks and multi-turn dialogue
  capabilities through instruction tuning.
  The TAIDE model is incorporating text and training materials from various fields in Taiwan to enhance
  the model's ability to respond in Traditional Chinese and perform specific tasks such as automatic
  summarization, writing emails, articles, and translating between Chinese and English.

technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: 128
  Context length: 4096
  Number of parameters: 8B
  Model size: 4.8GB
  Precision: w4a16 + w8a16 (few layers)
  Num of key-value heads: 8
  Model-1 (Prompt Processor): Llama-PromptProcessor-Quantized
  Prompt processor input: 128 tokens + position embeddings + attention mask + KV cache inputs
  Prompt processor output: 128 output tokens + KV cache outputs
  Model-2 (Token Generator): Llama-TokenGenerator-Quantized
  Token generator input: 1 input token + position embeddings + attention mask + KV cache inputs
  Token generator output: 1 output token + KV cache outputs
  Use: Initiate conversation with prompt-processor and then token generator for subsequent iterations.
  Minimum QNN SDK version required: 2.27.7
  Supported languages: English, Traditional Chinese
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (4096 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
