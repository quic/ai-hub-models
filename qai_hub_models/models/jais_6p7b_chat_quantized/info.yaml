description: JAIS 6.7B is a bilingual large language model (LLM) for both Arabic and English developed by Inception, a G42 company in partnership with MBZUAI and Cerebras. This is a 6.7 billion parameter LLM, trained on a dataset containing 141 billion Arabic tokens and 339 billion English/code tokens. The model is based on transformer-based decoder-only (GPT-3) architecture and uses SwiGLU non-linearity. It implements ALiBi position embeddings, enabling the model to extrapolate to long sequence lengths, providing improved context handling and model precision. The JAIS family of models is a comprehensive series of bilingual English-Arabic LLMs. These models are optimized to excel in Arabic while having strong English capabilities.

model_maker_id: g42
technical_details:
  Input sequence length for Prompt Processor: 128
  Max context length: 2048
  Number of parameters: 6.7B
  Precision: w4a16 + w8a16 (a few layers)
  Use: Initiate conversation with prompt-processor and then token generator for subsequent iterations.
  Supported languages: Arabic (MSA) and English.
  Minimum QNN SDK version required: 2.27.7
  TTFT: Time To First Token is the time it takes to generate the first response token. This is expressed as a range because it varies based on the length of the prompt. The lower bound is for a short prompt (up to 128 tokens, i.e., one iteration of the prompt processor) and the upper bound is for a prompt using the full context length (2048 tokens).
  Response Rate: Rate of response generation after the first response token.
