    Patch MMCV so that the native / CUDA extension loader does nothing while importing dependencies.

    This allows:
     - mmcv-lite to be used throughout the repository instead of full MMCV
     - newer torch versions to be used. MMCV is shipped with 2.4.1 compatibility by default.

    USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
        - AI Hub Models should not depend on any native MMCV ops to trace or run models.
          If a native op is required, it should be patched with a python implementation below.

        - If native ops are 'loaded' while this patch is in effect, they will all fail when used.
